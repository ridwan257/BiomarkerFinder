# BiomarkerFinder

This repository contains the code and analysis for identifying potential key protective genes in somkers that may cause delayed progession of lung cancer using 2 microarray expression dataset. The workflows integrates Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis, meta-analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning techniques to find out key biomarkers.
